            <h4>WHAT IS APEX?</h4>
            <p>Apex is not a brand; it is a lifestyle rooted in action.</p>        
            <h4>APEX PHILOSOPHY</h4>
            <p>Our philosophy draws from Ancient philosophy, Abrahamic religions, Eastern religions, and other sources of timeless wisdom.</p>
            <p>Every individual has a responsibility to live meaningfully â€” both to ourselves and society. You create your own definition of "meaningful".</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ancient philosophies, especially the Stoics, teach the pursuit of wisdom and virtue.</li>
                <li>Abrahamic religions emphasize moral responsibility, community, and purpose.</li>
                <li>Eastern religions focus on balance, mindfulness, and the interconnectedness of life.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>APEX MISSION</h4>
            <p>Our mission is to redefine what self-improvement means on social media.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ancient philosophies, especially the Stoics, teach the pursuit of wisdom and virtue.</li>
                <li>Abrahamic religions emphasize moral responsibility, community, and purpose.</li>
                <li>Eastern religions focus on balance, mindfulness, and the interconnectedness of life.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In order to do this, we will begin by creating content and building tools. Our operations as a company will evolve over time, but our founding principles and mission will not.</p>
